# PERN-E-Commerce-App

PERN-App (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js) implemented as an online bike store. Users can create accounts, view products, add products to a cart, and place/view orders


## Running the app

1. Install Node.js and PostgreSQL: Make sure you have Node.js and PostgreSQL installed on your system.

2. This project requires a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database to be running locally.  Reference the ERD diagram located in the `resources` folder of this repo to view the structure of the tables.  You can use [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) to interact with the database manually.

3. This repo includes an `example.env` file that contains important environment variables for reference.  Make sure to create a `.env` file and include all variables found in the `example.env` file, replacing the example values with those specific to your environment/needs.

5. Run `npm install` in the server directory to install the server dependencies.

6. Run `npm start` in the server directory to start the server.

7. Run `npm install` in the client directory to install the client dependencies.

8. Run `npm start` in the client directory to start the client.

9. Start the app by starting both the server and the client. For development run `npm run dev` in the root directory.

10. Once the app is running locally, you can access it in a browser at `http://localhost:<your-port>`
